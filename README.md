Welcome to the Cloud Computing and Networking project component. In this project, I will be developing a Cloud Management System using QEMU and Docker. The system will allow me to perform various operations on virtual machines (VMs) and Docker based on my input. The goal of the project is to enhance my understanding of virtualization technologies and system management.

Project Objectives:
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

Create a Virtual Machine: I will implement a feature that enables me to create VMs based on specific input parameters, including options for CPU, memory, and disk configuration. My input can come from either interactive prompts or a configuration file.

Create Dockerfile: I will create a feature that allows me to generate a Dockerfile for Docker images. The system will prompt me for the path to save the Dockerfile and the contents to include.

Build Docker Image: I will implement a feature that enables me to create a Docker image by providing the Dockerfile to use and specifying the image name or tag.

List Docker Images: I will develop a feature to list all the Docker images present on my system.

List Running Containers: I will create a feature that allows me to view all the running containers.

Stop a Container: I will add functionality to stop a specific container based on my input.

Search for an Image: I will implement a feature that allows me to search for a Docker image by inputting the image name or tag and viewing the results.

Search for Image on DockerHub: I will create a feature that enables me to search for an image on DockerHub by entering the image name.

Download/Pull Image: I will implement a feature that allows me to download a Docker image from DockerHub.
